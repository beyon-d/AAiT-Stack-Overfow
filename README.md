# AAiT-Stack-Overfow
A search website for AAiT students

AAiT stack overflow
Students often suffer to get information and material in university. Or they spend a lot of time trying to look for specific information on the internet or from friends. What if they can find all the material and information at one place?
Trying to solve this local and much faced problem of ours lead to the birth of our website, AAiT Stack overflow. Our website is a website that allows AAiT students to exchange material, share information and their knowledge through the website. We took our name from the international stack overflow, which is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers. Our website is aimed to achieve the same goals, but for AAiT students. It will create the opportunity for students to access course materials, assignments, former exams, any questions about their course and answer asked questions. Authorized students will be the ones posting those on the website. And any student can ask and answer a question.
To sign up students will use their AAiT id, email address and user name. The admins will make sure that it is a valid student id and email. Then they will be able to log in the website. They can upload files (modules, slides, assignments, exams) but admins will make sure it is actually a study material before posting it. Then it will be open for all and students can access and download them. They can also ask and answer questions which will go through the same authorization process as the files.
